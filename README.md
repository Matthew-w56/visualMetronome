# Visual Metronome
 Graphical metronome used for musical arrangement creation

For a time, I spent time here and there arranging songs that I liked as piano solos
so that I could play them.  But a common problem among ameteur arrangements is that
the timing is all off for the melody.  So, I created this tool that allows the user
to visually see how the notes fall in with the beats

<b>How it works:</b><br>
The user sets the beat by clicking anywhere in the window on beat as the song plays,
then pressing the space bar to lock the bpm and begin marking the melody notes.  The 
spacebar can then be pressed to pause the screen's scroll effect to review the notes

(JAR file in with code)

# Later Renditions

You can see an updated prototype of this project integrated into the project that I
architected, lead the development of, and polished myself: Arrange.  It is a sheet
music editing application that was done as part of a year-long school project with a
team of 4 people.  Once you download the application (Sorry, Mac users), open the tools
menu and go to the "Generative Metronome". 

### Notable Differences

The new tool has a better interface, a tempo setting (as opposed to tapping it yourself),
and generates the notes visually for you, rather than requiring you to visually analyze
the lines on the page.  Then, since it is a sheet music notation program, it also allows
you to copy paste your notes into a score, and export those to either our webpage where
users can share songs for free, or a common format such as MusicXML.
