# visualMetronome
 Graphical metronome used for musical arrangement creation

For a time, I spent time here and here arranging songs that I liked as piano solos
so that I could play them.  But a common problem among ameteur arrangements is that
the timing is all off for the melody.  So, I created this tool that allows the user
to visually see how the notes fall in with the beats

<b>How it works:</b><br>
The user sets the beat by clicking anywhere in the window on beat as the song plays,
then pressing the space bar to lock the bpm and begin marking the melody notes.  The 
spacebar can then be pressed to pause the screen's scroll effect to review the notes
